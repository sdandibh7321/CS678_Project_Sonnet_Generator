A melody of words that fills the air.
With quill in hand, the poet writes the night,
In iambic patterns, dreams take flight,
In sonnet's rhythm, where emotions alight,
A dance of hearts, a tapestry so bright.
As seasons pass and shadows gently play,
The sonnet stands, a monument in rhyme,
In ink-stained pages, love finds its way,
A testament to passion, sweet and prime.
So let these lines, like whispers on the breeze,
Compose a sonnet, dancing through the trees."
